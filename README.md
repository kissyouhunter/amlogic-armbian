## Install to EMMC and update instructions

Choose the corresponding firmware according to your STB. Then write the IMG file to the USB hard disk through software such as [Rufus](https://rufus.ie/) or [balenaEtcher](https://www.balena.io/etcher/). Insert the USB hard disk into the STB. Common for all `Amlogic S9xxx STB`.

- ### Install Armbian to EMMC

Login in to armbian (default user: root, default password: 1234) â†’ input command:

```yaml
armbian-install
```

- ### Update Armbian Kernel

Query the available [kernel_version](https://github.com/ophub/flippy-kernel/tree/main/library). Login in to armbian â†’ input command:

```yaml
# Run as root user (sudo -i), input command: armbian-update <kernel_version>
armbian-update 5.10.66
```

- ### Install Docker Service

Login in to armbian â†’ input command:

```yaml
armbian-docker
```

- ### Modify Armbian Config

Login in to armbian â†’ input command:

```yaml
armbian-config
```

- ### Create swap for Armbian

If you feel that the memory of the current box is not enough when you are using applications with a large memory footprint such as `docker`, you can create a `swap` virtual memory partition, Change the disk space a certain capacity is virtualized into memory for use. The unit of the input parameter of the following command is `GB`, and the default is `1`.

Login in to armbian â†’ input command:

```yaml
armbian-swap 1
```

- ### Use Armbian in TF/USB

To activate the remaining space of TF/USB, please login in to armbian â†’ input command:

```yaml
armbian-tf
```

<details>
  <summary>Or manually allocate the remaining space</summary>

#### View [Operation screenshot](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/68696949/137860992-fbd4e2fa-e90c-4bbb-8985-7f5db9f49927.jpg)

```yaml
# 1. Confirm the name of the TF/USB according to the size of the space. The TF is [ `mmcblk` ], USB is [ `sd` ]
Command: Enter [ fdisk -l | grep "sd" ]

# 2. Get the starting value of the remaining space, Copy and save, used below  (E.g: 5382144)
Command: Enter [ fdisk -l | grep "sd" | sed -n '$p' | awk '{print $3}' | xargs -i expr {} + 1 ]

# 3. Start allocating unused space (E.g: sda, mmcblk0 or mmcblk1)
Command: Enter [ fdisk /dev/sda ] Start allocating the remaining space
Command: Select [ n ] to create a partition
Command: Select [ p ] to specify the partition type as primary partition
Command: Set the partition number to [ 3 ]
Command: The start value of the partition, enter the value obtained in the second step, E.g: [ 5382144 ]
Command: End value, press [ Enter ] to use the default value
Command: If there is a hint: Do you want to remove the signature? [Y]es/[N]o: Enter [ Y ]
Command: Enter [ t ] to specify the partition type
Command: Enter Partition number [ 3 ]
Command: Enter Hex code (type L to list all codes): [ 83 ]
Command: Enter [ w ] to save
Command: Enter [ reboot ] to restart

# 4. After restarting, format the new partition
Command: Enter [ mkfs.ext4 -F -L SHARED /dev/sda3 ] to format the new partition

# 5. Set the mount directory for the new partition
Command: Enter [ mkdir -p /mnt/share ] to Create mount directory
Command: Enter [ mount -t ext4 /dev/sda3 /mnt/share ] to Mount the newly created partition to the directory

# 6. Add automatic mount at boot
Command: Enter [ vi /etc/fstab ]
# Press [ i ] to enter the input mode, copy the following values to the end of the file
/dev/sda3 /mnt/share ext4 defaults 0 0
# Press [ esc ] to exit, Input [ :wq! ] and [ Enter ] to Save, Finish.

## Armbian firmware make method

- Different amlogic armbian firmware, use the corresponding soc code to generate. Please choose according to your box soc model. Supported soc are `s922x`, `s922x-n2`, `s905x3`, `s905x2`, `s912`, `s905d`, `s905x`, `s905w`. Note: `s922x-n2` is `s922x-odroid-n2`.

- compile `a single soc` can be directly input `sudo ./make s905x3`. When `multiple soc` is compiled at the same time, please use `_` to connect multiple soc, such as `sudo ./make s922x_s905x3`

- Optionality: Replace the kernel. Run Eg: `sudo ./make s905x 5.4.150`. When multiple kernel versions are generated at one time, the kernel version number is connected with `_` . Run Eg: `sudo ./make s922x_s905x3 5.10.70_5.4.150`.  When there is an latest version of the same series of the specified kernel version, the `latest version` will be download from [kernel library](https://github.com/ophub/flippy-kernel/tree/main/library) and used automatically. When you want to compile a `fixed kernel`, Run `sudo ./make s905x 5.4.150 false`.

ðŸ’¡Tips: The ***`s905x`*** and ***`s905w`*** boxs currently only support `5.4.*` kernels, Cannot use kernel version 5.10 and above. Please add kernel substitution variables when compiling these two models of devices. Other devices can be freely selected.

- ### Use GitHub Action to make instructions

1. Workflows configuration in [.yml](.github/workflows) files. Set the armbian `soc` you want to make in `Make Armbian for amlogic s9xxx`.

2. New compilation: Select ***`Build Armbian For Amlogic`*** on the [Action](https://github.com/ophub/amlogic-s9xxx-armbian/actions) page. Click the ***`Run workflow`*** button.

3. Compile again: If there is an `Armbian_.*-trunk_.*.img.gz` file in [Releases](https://github.com/ophub/amlogic-s9xxx-armbian/releases), you do not need to compile it completely, you can directly use this file to `build armbian` of different soc. Select ***`Use Releases file to build`*** on the [Action](https://github.com/ophub/amlogic-s9xxx-armbian/actions) page. Click the ***`Run workflow`*** button.

- ### Local make instructions

1. Install the necessary packages (E.g Ubuntu 20.04 LTS user)
```yaml
sudo apt-get update -y
sudo apt-get full-upgrade -y
sudo apt-get install -y $(curl -fsSL git.io/ubuntu-2004-server)
```
2. Clone the repository to the local. `git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/ophub/amlogic-s9xxx-armbian.git`
3. Create the `build/output/images` folder, and upload the Armbian image of the `lepotato` board ( Eg: `Armbian_21.11.0-trunk_Lepotato_buster_current_5.10.67.img` ) to this `~/amlogic-s9xxx-armbian/build/output/images` directory.
4. Enter the `~/amlogic-s9xxx-armbian` root directory. And run Eg: `sudo ./make s905x3` to make armbian for `amlogic s9xxx`. The generated Armbian image is in the `build/output/images` directory under the root directory.

## Borrow

The [armbian](https://github.com/armbian/build) directly calls the official source code for compilation, When making dedicated Armbian systems for different boxes, the kernel, scripts, u-boot and other resources made by [flippy](https://github.com/unifreq/openwrt_packit) for `Amlogic s9xxx openwrt` are used. The development idea of the program comes from the tutorials of authors such as [ebkso](https://www.kflyo.com/howto-compile-armbian-for-n1-box). Thank you for your dedication and sharing, so that we can use the Armbian system in the Amlogic s9xxx box.
