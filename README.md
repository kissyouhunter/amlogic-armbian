View Chinese description  |  [æŸ¥çœ‹ä¸­æ–‡è¯´æ˜Ž](README.cn.md)

The [Armbian](https://www.armbian.com/) system is a lightweight Linux system based on Debian/Ubuntu built specifically for ARM chips. The Armbian system is lean, clean, and 100% compatible and inherits the functions and rich software ecosystem of the Debian/Ubuntu system. It can run safely and stably in TF/SD/USB and the eMMC of the device.

Now you can replace the Android TV system of the TV box with the Amlogic chip with the Armbian system, making it a powerful server. This project builds Armbian system for Amlogic s9xxx TV box. including install to EMMC and update related functions. Support Amlogic s9xxx TV Boxes are ***`a311d, s922x, s905x3, s905x2, s905l3a, s912, s905d, s905x, s905w, s905`***, etc. such as ***`Belink GT-King, Belink GT-King Pro, UGOOS AM6 Plus, X96-Max+, HK1-Box, H96-Max-X3, Phicomm-N1, Octopus-Planet, Fiberhome HG680P, ZTE B860H`***, etc. Please refer to the [Armbian Documentation](build-armbian/armbian-docs) for the usage method.

ðŸ’¡Tip: The current ***`s905w`*** series of TV Boxes only support the use of the `5.15.y` kernel, Other types of TV Boxes can use optional kernel versions. Currently ***`s905`*** TV Boxes can only be used in `TF/SD/USB`, other types of TV Boxes also support writing to `EMMC`. Please refer to the [instructions](build-armbian/armbian-docs/amlogic_model_database.md) for dtb and u-boot of each device.

## Install to EMMC and update instructions

Choose the corresponding firmware according to your box. Then write the IMG file to the USB hard disk through software such as [Rufus](https://rufus.ie/) or [balenaEtcher](https://www.balena.io/etcher/). Insert the USB hard disk into the box. Common for all `Amlogic s9xxx TV Boxes`.

- ### Install Armbian to EMMC

Login in to armbian (default user: root, default password: 1234) â†’ input command:

```yaml
armbian-install
```

The mainline u-boot is installed by default, In order to support the use of 5.10 and above kernels. If you choose not to install, specify it in the `1` input parameter, e.g. `armbian-install no`

- ### Update Armbian Kernel

Login in to armbian â†’ input command:

```yaml
# Run as root user (sudo -i)
# If no other parameters are specified, the following update command will update to the latest version of the current kernel of the same series.
armbian-update
```

If there is a set of kernel files in the current directory, it will be updated with the kernel in the current directory (The 4 kernel files required for the update are `header-xxx.tar.gz`, `boot-xxx.tar.gz`, `dtb-amlogic-xxx.tar.gz`, `modules-xxx.tar.gz`. Other kernel files are not required. If they exist at the same time, it will not affect the update. The system can accurately identify the required kernel files). If there is no kernel file in the current directory, it will query and download the latest kernel of the same series from the server for update. You can also query the [optional kernel](https://github.com/ophub/kernel/tree/main/pub/stable) version and update the specified version: `armbian-update 5.10.100`. The optional kernel supported by the device can be freely updated, such as from 5.10.100 kernel to 5.15.25 kernel. When the kernel is updated, By default, download from [stable](https://github.com/ophub/kernel/tree/main/pub/stable) kernel version branch, if you download other [version branch](https://github.com/ophub/kernel/tree/main/pub), please specify according to the branch folder name in the `2` parameter, such as `armbian-update 5.7.19 dev` . The mainline u-boot will be installed automatically by default, which has better support for kernels using versions above 5.10. If you choose not to install, please specify it in the `3` input parameter, such as `armbian-update 5.10.100 stable no `

- ### Install Docker Service
