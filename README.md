ðŸ’¡Tip: The current box of ***`s905`*** can only be used in `TF/SD/USB`, and other types of boxes can also be used in `EMMC` at the same time. The ***`s905w`*** boxs currently only support `5.4` kernels, Cannot use kernel version 5.10 and above, Other devices can be freely selected. Please refer to the [instructions](build-armbian/amlogic-u-boot/README.md) for dtb and u-boot of each device.

## Install to EMMC and update instructions

Choose the corresponding firmware according to your box. Then write the IMG file to the USB hard disk through software such as [Rufus](https://rufus.ie/) or [balenaEtcher](https://www.balena.io/etcher/). Insert the USB hard disk into the box. Common for all `Amlogic s9xxx tv box`.

- ### Install Armbian to EMMC

Login in to armbian (default user: root, default password: 1234) â†’ input command:

```yaml
armbian-install
```

- ### Update Armbian Kernel

Query the available [kernel_version](https://github.com/ophub/kernel/tree/main/pub/stable). Login in to armbian â†’ input command:

```yaml
# Run as root user (sudo -i), input command: armbian-update <kernel_version>
armbian-update 5.4.170
```

If there is a complete set of kernel files in the current directory, you can run the `armbian-update` command to install this kernel. The kernel update script will be continuously updated during development. You can use this command to update the local script synchronously: `wget -O /usr/sbin/armbian-update git.io/armbian-update` . Or directly use the latest script on the server side to update the kernel: `bash <(curl -fsSL git.io/armbian-update) 5.4.170`

When the kernel is updated, By default, download from [stable](https://github.com/ophub/kernel/tree/main/pub/stable) kernel version branch, if you download other [version branch](https://github.com/ophub/kernel/tree/main/pub), please specify according to the branch folder name in the `second` parameter, such as `armbian-update 5.7.19 dev` . The mainline u-boot is automatically installed by default, which can better support the use of kernel series 5.10 and above. If you choose not to install, please specify in the `third` input parameter, such as `armbian-update 5.4.170 stable no`

The `headers` files in the kernel is installed in the `/use/local/include` directory. When compiling the application, add `-I /usr/local/include` to the `CFLAG` parameter of `GCC` to find the headers files.

- ### Install Docker Service

Login in to armbian â†’ input command:

```yaml
armbian-docker
```

After installing docker, you can choose whether to install the `portainer` visual management panel. Users who intend to use the `LAN IP` for management can choose (`h`) to install the `http://ip:9000` version; Users who intend to use the `domain name` for remote management can choose (`s`) to install the `https://domain:9000` domain name certificate version (Please name the domain name `SSL` certificate as `portainer.crt` and `portainer.key` and upload it to the `/etc/ssl/` directory); Users who `do not need` to install can choose (`n`) to end the installation.

```yaml
sudo apt-get update -y
sudo apt-get full-upgrade -y
sudo apt-get install -y $(curl -fsSL git.io/ubuntu-2004-server)
```

2. Clone the repository to the local. `git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/ophub/amlogic-s9xxx-armbian.git`

3. Create the `build/output/images` folder, and upload the Armbian image ( Eg: `Armbian_21.11.0-trunk_Lepotato_current_5.10.90.img` ) to this `~/amlogic-s9xxx-armbian/build/output/images` directory. Please keep the release version number (e.g. `21.11.0`) and kernel version number (e.g. `5.10.90`) in the name of the original Armbian image file, It will be used as the name of the armbian firmware after rebuilding.

4. Enter the `~/amlogic-s9xxx-armbian` root directory. And run Eg: `sudo ./rebuild -d -b s905x3 -k 5.4.170` to build armbian for `amlogic s9xxx`. The generated Armbian image is in the `build/output/images` directory under the root directory.

- ### Use GitHub Action to build

1. Workflows configuration in [.yml](.github/workflows/build-armbian.yml) files. Set the armbian `SOC` you want to build in `Rebuild Armbian for amlogic s9xxx`.

2. New compilation: Select ***`Build armbian`*** on the [Action](https://github.com/ophub/amlogic-s9xxx-armbian/actions) page, According to the OS version officially supported by Armbian, In [RELEASE](https://docs.armbian.com/Developer-Guide_Build-Options/), you can choose Ubuntu series: `focal`, or Debian series: `bullseye` / `buster`, and in `BOARD`, you can choose `lepotato` / `odroidn2`, etc., You can add more setting options for `compile.sh` in `More build options` as needed. Click the ***`Run workflow`*** button.

3. Compile again: If there is an `Armbian_.*-trunk_.*.img.gz` file in [Releases](https://github.com/ophub/amlogic-s9xxx-armbian/releases), you do not need to compile it completely, you can directly use this file to `build armbian` of different soc. Select ***`Use Releases file to build armbian`*** on the [Action](https://github.com/ophub/amlogic-s9xxx-armbian/actions) page. Click the ***`Run workflow`*** button.

## Armbian contributor list

First of all, I would like to thank [150balbes](https://github.com/150balbes) for his outstanding contributions and a good foundation for using Armbian in the Amlogic box. The [armbian](https://github.com/armbian/build) system compiled here directly uses the latest official source code for real-time compilation, When making dedicated Armbian systems for different boxes, the kernel, scripts, u-boot and other resources made by [unifreq](https://github.com/unifreq/openwrt_packit) for `Amlogic s9xxx openwrt` are used. The development idea of the program comes from the tutorials of authors such as [ebkso](https://www.kflyo.com/howto-compile-armbian-for-n1-box). Thank you for your dedication and sharing, so that we can use the Armbian system in the Amlogic s9xxx box.

Because of these [innovations and contributors](CONTRIBUTOR.md), we can have the company of the box in the long river of years. We have grown up many years later, but this beautiful memory will always stay deep in the memory for a long time. From now on, record the achievements of these pioneers and leave them to the new friends who have joined the box circle.
